# Multi-Vehicle Search API

A search algorithm that allows renters to find storage locations for multiple vehicles. This API implements a variant of the bin packing problem to find optimal storage combinations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-vehicle search**: Find storage for up to 5 vehicles simultaneously
- **Optimal pricing**: Returns the cheapest possible combination per location
- **Fast response**: Sub-300ms response times
- **Comprehensive results**: Returns all possible locations that can accommodate the vehicles
- **RESTful API**: Clean, well-documented endpoints

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

## üßÆ Algorithm

This API implements a variant of the **bin packing problem** with the following approach:

1. **Vehicle Processing**: Convert input vehicles into individual units with dimensions (length √ó 10 feet width)
2. **Location Grouping**: Group all listings by location_id
3. **Feasibility Check**: For each location, check if all vehicles can fit using a bin packing algorithm
4. **Optimal Combination**: Find the cheapest combination of listings for each feasible location
5. **Result Sorting**: Sort results by total price in ascending order

### Key Features:
- **Greedy Bin Packing**: Uses a greedy approach with backtracking for optimal space utilization
- **Price Optimization**: Sorts listings by price per unit area for cost efficiency
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Ensures all vehicles fit within the available space
- **Comprehensive Search**: Returns all possible solutions, not just the first match

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python test_api.py
```

The test suite includes:
- Health check validation
- Single vehicle search
- Multiple vehicle search
- Invalid input handling
- README example verification
- Performance testing (response time < 300ms)

## üìä Performance

- **Response Time**: < 300ms for typical queries
- **Data Scale**: Handles 1,000+ listings across 365+ locations
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient in-memory processing
- **Scalability**: Optimized algorithms for real-time performance

## üìù API Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Vehicle
```bash
# Local development
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"length": 10, "quantity": 1}]'

# Railway deployment
curl -X POST "https://your-project.railway.app/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"length": 10, "quantity": 1}]'
```

    {"length": 20, "quantity": 2},
    {"length": 25, "quantity": 1}
  ]'

# Railway deployment
curl -X POST "https://your-project.railway.app/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[
    {"length": 10, "quantity": 1},
    {"length": 20, "quantity": 2},
    {"length": 25, "quantity": 1}
  ]'
```

## üîß Configuration

### Vehicle Constraints
- Maximum 5 vehicles total per request
- Vehicle width is fixed at 10 feet
- Vehicle length must be specified in feet

### Listing Data
- 1,000+ listings across 365+ locations
- Price range: $10.05 - $998.89
- 25 different size combinations
- All dimensions are multiples of 10

## üêõ Error Handling

The API handles various error conditions:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input (too many vehicles, empty request)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Data loading issues

## üìà Future Improvements

- [ ] Caching for improved performance
- [ ] Database integration for dynamic data
- [ ] Advanced bin packing algorithms
- [ ] Real-time availability checking
- [ ] Geographic filtering
- [ ] User authentication and preferences
